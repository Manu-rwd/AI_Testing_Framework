Highlights

- Module 11 — Finalize flow hardened and completed:
  - Initial PowerShell failures: Unicode in commit messages, BOM in mypy.ini, missing feature branch for ancestry, PSReadLine console crashes.
  - Delivered safe finalize scripts: `finalize_module11.ps1`, `finalize_module11_auto.ps1`, and a reusable `finalize_module.ps1` (UTF‑8 no BOM writes, ASCII‑only commit messages, conditional branch reconstruction, ancestry check, force‑add merge note even if docs/ is ignored).
  - Outcome: gates/tests green; merge note written under `qa-framework/docs/changes/merges/YYYY-MM-DD_module11_ingestor_merge.md`.

- Module 12 — Alignment to roadmap:
  - Clarified Module 12 should be Coverage Overlay Exporter (feature/coverage-overlays); provided corrected handover parameters and prompt scaffold.

- Module 13 — Merge Engine v2 implemented and fixed:
  - New package `@pkg/merge` with deterministic deep merge (US > Project > UI/UX > Coverage > Defaults) and sibling `__prov` provenance keys; CLI `merge-plan` and tests.
  - Finalize script for Module 13 added; initial workspace test failures due to UI/UX converter idempotence test input dependency and feature branch pull flow; fixed by PS5‑safe flow, dynamic dates, and making the converter test skip when the PDF is missing.
  - Provenance bumps updated to accept `qa_library` (+0.01) alongside `coverage`; added `.gitignore` to avoid committing transformed test JS.
  - Fix branch `feature/merge-engine-v2-fix1` merged to main; workspace tests fully green; merge note written.

Takeaways

- Finalize pipeline standardized (Python gates, JS tests, safe merge, ancestry, merge note) with Windows‑safe, idempotent scripts and ASCII‑only commits.
- Workspace gates policy affirmed (run all packages) with pragmatic skip for tests needing external assets.
