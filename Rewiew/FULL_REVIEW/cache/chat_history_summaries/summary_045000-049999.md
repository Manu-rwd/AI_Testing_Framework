Highlights

- Module 5 — Automation Plan Emitter hardening and validation:
  - CSV escaping fixed for embedded quotes; BOM + CRLF + header order verified via PowerShell checks.
  - MD emitter adjusted to include feasibility badges and expected sections; confidence formatted to 2 decimals; notes include feasibility rationale.
  - Planner v2 CLI emits both CSV/MD successfully; Windows-safe commands used (no `&&`).

- Review Tools e2e stability (Windows):
  - Added BOM stripping utility (`stripBom`) for CSV header reads; prevents `\uFEFFmodule` header issues.
  - Hardened e2e harness with a Node launcher (execaNode), explicit cwd, and shell=false; direct built CLI invocation returns exit 0.
  - Fixed missing fixture by generating BOM+CRLF CSV inline; review:init now consistently writes `.review.csv`.

- Module 6 — Selector Strategy & Data Profiles (delivery and merge):
  - Selector/data profile resolvers integrated into Planner v2 emit; precedence US > project > defaults; confidence bump applied.
  - Example project standards added; MD shows strategy/profile sections; tests (unit + e2e) pass; merged into main.

- Module 7 — Review extension CLI (extend_csv):
  - Appends review columns (disposition, feasibility, selector_needs, parameter_needs, notes); idempotent; optional JSON sidecar.
  - Addressed tsx/globby path issues by resolving workspace `node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs` and implementing custom Windows-friendly glob expansion; fixed regex edge cases.
  - Final runs show all tests green (19/19 → 20/20), including CLI e2e for globs/out/backup/sidecar.

Notes

- Multiple Windows pitfalls addressed: avoid `&&`, prefer `pnpm -C`, ensure UTF-8; when needed, run CLI via built `dist/cli/index.js`.
- CI readiness improved with deterministic test harness and explicit cwd/dist resolution; repo hygiene maintained (.gitattributes/.gitignore).
