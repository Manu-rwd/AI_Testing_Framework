Highlights

- Module 13 — fix branch merged and closed out:
  - Workspace gates green (flake8 OK, mypy OK, JS tests OK) including planner suites.
  - Fix branch `feature/merge-engine-v2-fix1` merged to main; merge notes present:
    - `qa-framework/docs/changes/merges/2025-10-02_module13_merge_engine_v2_merge.md`
    - `qa-framework/docs/changes/merges/2025-10-02_module13_merge_engine_v2_fix.md`

- Module 14 — Manual QA Emitter (strict parity) scaffolding and finalize flow:
  - New package `@pkg/manual-emitter` created with config and CLI: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `.gitignore`, `src/types.ts`, `src/emit.ts`, `src/index.ts`, tests (`test/fixtures/merged_min.json`, `test/emit.spec.ts`), and `README.md`.
  - Root scripts updated: `manual:emit` delegates to package CLI.
  - Emitter behavior: strict template parity (fixed headings/sections), filter by Tip functionalitate, optional General valabile=1 filter, deterministic ordering, no metadata leaks to Markdown.

- Finalize script for Module 14 (Windows/PowerShell 5.1-safe):
  - Issues encountered: unary `-` bullets inside here-strings, quote escaping, and PS parsing errors.
  - Fixes applied: scope pnpm with `-C qa-framework`, ASCII-only commit subjects, UTF-8 no BOM writes, build merge note by joining an array of lines (no tricky quoting), smoke-run the CLI, re-run workspace tests, conditional branch creation/push/merge, and write merge note under `qa-framework/docs/changes/merges/YYYY-MM-DD_module14_manual_qa_emitter_merge.md`.
  - Git flow: create/switch `feature/manual-qa-emitter-v1` → commit/push → merge into `main` → re-run tests → push merge note.

- Practices reinforced
  - Keep tests green across workspace; skip asset-dependent tests when required inputs are missing.
  - Prefer `pdftohtml` for PDF ingestion; use repo-local tools and explicit flags.
  - Use ASCII-only commit subjects and UTF-8 (no BOM) for config/notes.
