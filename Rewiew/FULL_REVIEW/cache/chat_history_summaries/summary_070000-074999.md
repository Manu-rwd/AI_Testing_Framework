Range: 70,000–74,999

Highlights

- Module 10 (UI/UX Converter) merges and polish:
  - PDF→HTML priority clarified: prefer `pdftohtml`; `pandoc` cannot ingest PDF (only outputs to PDF).
  - Repo-local binary resolution added with flags `--pandoc`/`--pdftohtml`; tests for resolver and logging guidance.
  - Windows stability: path fixes and explicit cwd for E2Es; converter tests green aside from asset-dependent idempotence case handled elsewhere.

- No net-new themes vs prior window; docs already reflected these behaviors and guidance.
