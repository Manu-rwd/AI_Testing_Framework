Highlights

- Planner v1.7 (coverage-driven) finalized:
  - Canonical signature matching (module/bucket/tip + canon_pattern + facet_set) with synonym maps; targets: CRUD ≥95%, visual ≥85%.
  - Deltas surfaced (missing/extra/mismatched) and policies to split headers vs values and ASC/DESC sort.

- UI/UX integration modules planned and partially implemented:
  - Module 10 (UI/UX Guide Converter) created; adds repo-local binary detection and flags `--pandoc`/`--pdftohtml`; snapshot/idempotence tests; Windows guidance.
  - Module 10.2 (Local bins): auto-discover under `qa-framework/tools/`; unit tests for resolver/logs; all tests green.
  - Noted: pandoc cannot convert from PDF ("Unknown input format pdf"); prefer `pdftohtml` for HTML then process.

- Coverage Overlays & parity path:
  - Coverage Overlay Exporter (Excel → YAML) defined to pull QA families; Parity Scorer to measure % and list deltas.
  - Merge precedence updated to: US > Project > UI/UX > QA Overlays > Defaults.

- Windows workflow fixes:
  - Run from repo root or drop `-C`; add binary on PATH or use repo-local tools; provided one-liners for Scoop/Chocolatey or portable binaries in repo.
