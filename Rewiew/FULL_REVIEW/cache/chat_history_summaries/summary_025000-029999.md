Highlights

- Finalized Manual Plan Emitter whitespace fixes (front-matter spacing, case separators) with stable tests and CLI verifier; addressed Windows mojibake as console-only.
- Module 5 — Automation Plan Emitter implemented:
  - New emitter under `packages/planner/src/emitter/automation/*` plus CLI `emit-automation`.
  - CSV spec: UTF-8 BOM, CRLF, exact column order, compact JSON in `atoms`/`rule_tags`, proper quoting; MD mirrors rows with AAA and metadata.
  - Test suite added (`packages/planner/test/emitter/automation/*`), iteratively fixed header/BOM/quoting and ESM path issues until green.
  - Branch `feature/automation-emitter` created and pushed; demo outputs under `tmp_docs/` and `tmp_exports/` generated.
- Prepared Module 6 handover (Selector Strategy & Data Profiles): selector preference engine, data profile resolver, v2 enrich integration, CLI `plan:enrich`, and tests/fixtures plan.
