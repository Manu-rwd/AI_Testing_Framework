Scope: Lines 5,000–9,999 of Rewiew/Project_chat_history.md

Highlights:
- PR #2 (Planner + Rules) runs cleanly; `Plan_Adaugare.md` and `Plan_Adaugare.csv` generated; CSV enriched with review columns.
- Mojibake in PowerShell previews addressed (UTF-8 console tips). Files themselves are valid UTF-8 with correct diacritics.
- Follow-up commit adds CSV extender tool and pins planner deps; Accesare.csv extended with review columns.
- Kicked off Module Review for Accesare (Adăugare) with suggested dispositions, feasibility, selectors, parameters, and notes.
- Brainstorming pivot: add US Review Agent & normalization (confidence/gaps) before planner; strict vs. lax buckets; rule_tags; diacritics normalization.
- Research plan crafted and later integrated (tools landscape, best practices, stack guidance).

Outcomes shaping direction:
- Dual outputs confirmed as backbone: QA manual (strict template) + automation (atoms/metadata).
- US Review gate added to design; planner precheck flag envisioned (`--review-precheck`, `--min-confidence`).
- “Project” standards layer accepted: use project fallbacks with provenance and small confidence bump.
