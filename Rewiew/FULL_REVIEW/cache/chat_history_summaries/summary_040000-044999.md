Highlights

- Module 10 hardening (tests and CLI contracts):
  - Stabilized CLI E2E by resolving dist paths via __dirname and setting cwd where defaults depend on workspace root.
  - Enforced report output invariants: prints `Totals:` and final `WROTE <path>`; verify sets `process.exitCode = 0` on OK.
  - Fixed flaky path issues (no `process.cwd()` assumptions), removed accidental nested `qa-framework/` in planner.

- plan:emit E2E stabilization:
  - Adjusted E2E to run from workspace root and assert real defaults (`qa-framework/tmp_exports`, `qa-framework/tmp_docs`).
  - Optionally added `--outCsv` / `--outDocs` flags; defaults unchanged; tests green after cwd alignment.

- Repo hygiene and CI friendliness:
  - Added root `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` (LF normalization); purged tracked tmp and stray nested directories; renormalized EOLs.
  - Planner test suite reaches all green (25/25) after path/CLI fixes.

- Roadmap and tooling:
  - Roadmap updated with handover prompts, acceptance criteria, and CLI cheatsheets per module.
  - Added `repo_snapshot.ps1` (ASCII-safe, PS 5.1 compatible) to export repo status; fixed earlier mojibake issues.

- Windows shell guidance reinforced:
  - Avoid CLI globs on Windows (use Node recursion or pass explicit paths); avoid `&&`/`||` in PowerShell; prefer multi-line PS over one-liners to dodge PSReadLine bugs.
