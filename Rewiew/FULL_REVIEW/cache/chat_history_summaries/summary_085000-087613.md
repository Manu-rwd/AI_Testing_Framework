Highlights

- US→Manual bridge delivered and iterated:
  - Added `@apps/us2manual` (parse .txt → minimal plan-like → Module 16 emitter) with CLI `us:emit` and a wrapper `qa-framework/tools/us2manual.mjs` wired as `us:bridge`.
  - Heuristics: infer Tip (Vizualizare/Adăugare/Modificare/Ștergere/Activare), extract Columns, Pagination, Sorting fields, Auth/Resilience hints; emit per-section Markdown via the tuned emitter.
  - Folders created at repo root: `US_input/`, `Manual_output/` (note drift with `manual_output/` in some runs).
  - Runs show outputs like `Documente_Vizualizare_Manual.md`; bridge self-check added; provenance comments preserved (and later spec proposes optional hiding).

- Cursor one-shot prompts refined:
  - Polished prompts to implement the bridge (dependency-free ESM), auto-fix build/import, and enforce Module 16 style (overlay families, two lines/column, ASC/DESC, presence/pagination/responsive/resilience/auth, provenance).
  - Later spec tightens acceptance (fixed five sections order, canonical tag vocabulary, permissions-as-tests model, determinism/dedup), and proposes hiding provenance by default.

- Full repo analysis prompt executed:
  - Generated `docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` and `tmp/analysis/inventory.json`; inventory reports ~12 workspaces, notable CLIs (manual-emit, parity:score, merge-plan, planner, us2manual), and confirms Module 15/16 cores.
  - Recommendations: don’t rewrite core; standardize folder names; unify on one bridge entrypoint; add stricter parser/vocabulary and parity checks.
