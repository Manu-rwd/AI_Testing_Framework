Range: 60,000–64,999

Highlights

- Algorithm consolidation: v0.9 → v1.6
  - Formalized inputs/precedence (US > Project Standards > QA Library > Defaults), normalization, expansion packs (header filters validation, visual spec tokens, exit/interrupt variants), emission rules (manual/CSV), coverage scoring.
  - PVPFL-specific heuristics included (disabled selects rendered as read-only placeholders, table_object behaviors, duplicate PVPFL alert spec).

- PVPFL run and coverage
  - Generated QA-style manual list; ~82–85% overlap vs QA baseline; missing facets identified and codified in v1.6 (disabled-select placeholder assertions, visual tokens, exit/interrupt cases).
  - Next run targets ≥95% by using the updated expansions and provenance tags.

- Finalize & merge automation
  - `finalize_module.ps1` added and hardened for PS 5.1: UTF-8 no BOM writes, local venv gates (flake8/mypy), pnpm workspace tests, branch ensure/create, ancestry check (best-effort), merge to main, and merge note under `qa-framework/docs/changes/merges/`.
  - Addressed Windows quirks: quoting for paths with spaces, removed PS7-only features, increased specific test timeouts.
