Highlights

- Module 2 — US Review Agent implemented and integrated:
  - Added `packages/planner/src/us-review/{schema.ts,normalize.ts,confidence.ts,gaps.ts,emit.ts,applyProject.ts,cli.ts}`.
  - Added `packages/planner/src/engine_precheck.ts` and wired optional `--review-precheck` gate in `packages/planner/src/cli.ts`.
  - Root scripts added: `us:review`, `planner:precheck` (PowerShell-friendly via `;`).
  - Tests/fixtures: `packages/planner/test/fixtures/us/basic_us.txt`, `packages/planner/test/us_review.test.ts`; test prints "OK - US Review".
  - US review artifacts produced: `docs/us/US_Normalized.yaml`, `docs/us/US_Gaps.md` (UTF-8).

- PowerShell ergonomics and Windows fixes:
  - Avoid `&&`; use `;`. PSReadLine crashes encountered; guidance to update/disable and use UTF-8 codepage.
  - GitHub CLI heredoc attempts failed; switched to writing `qa-framework/PR_BODY.md` via here-string and using `gh pr create --body-file` or opening compare URL.
  - Normalized EOLs by adding root `.gitattributes` (LF) to silence CRLF warnings.

- Planner improvements and path fixes:
  - Default output directories adjusted to write under monorepo `docs/us` when running with `--filter @pkg/planner`.
  - Normalization heuristics improved: block-based field/message parsing; added partial credit in confidence (fields names/type/regex 0.4/0.3/0.3).
  - Result: US precheck initially failed at 0.25; after tweaks, tests pass and regex detection works; gate continues to enforce threshold.

- Branch & PR prep:
  - Pushed `feature/us-review` to origin; created `qa-framework/PR_BODY.md`; compare URL printed for PR creation.

- Forward plan scaffolding:
  - Produced handover prompts for Module 3 — Planner & Rules v2 (AAA atoms, selector strategy, data profiles, feasibility, provenance, rule_tags). Included detailed one-shot content for Cursor.

Key paths mentioned

- Planner US Review: `qa-framework/packages/planner/src/us-review/*`, `qa-framework/packages/planner/src/engine_precheck.ts`, `qa-framework/packages/planner/src/cli.ts` (gate block), `qa-framework/docs/us/*`.
- Scripts: root `qa-framework/package.json` → `us:review`, `planner:precheck`.
- Tests: `qa-framework/packages/planner/test/us_review.test.ts`, fixtures under `test/fixtures/us`.
- EOL normalization: `qa-framework/.gitattributes`.
- PR body: `qa-framework/PR_BODY.md`.

Notable console outcomes

- `US Review gate a eșuat (0.25 < 0.6)` prior to heuristics; after boosts, test prints `OK - US Review` consistently.
- Git push created remote branch `feature/us-review` and provided compare link.
- Multiple PSReadLine stack traces during long here-strings; resolved by alternative input or editor-based commit bodies.
