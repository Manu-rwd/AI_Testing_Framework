Highlights

- Module 4 hardening — Manual Plan Emitter whitespace stabilized:
  - Iterative fixes for blank-line drift ("Line 7") and list glue ("Efort: 32.") using strict template spacing, control tags on their own lines, no trims, and exactly one trailing newline.
  - Added `visibleDiff` helper and CLI `--verify-against` flag; snapshot and unit tests now deterministic and green.
  - Generated `qa-framework/docs/modules/Accesare_Manual.md` matching QA template.

- Windows/PowerShell guidance consolidated:
  - Use `;` instead of `&&`; avoid piping to `cat` in Windows PowerShell.
  - Force UTF-8 console (`chcp 65001` and `$OutputEncoding`).

- Line endings policy enforced:
  - Introduced `.editorconfig` (LF + final newline) and expanded `.gitattributes` to normalize LF.
  - Added a line-endings checker CLI (scoped to git-tracked sources, supports `--paths` and `--since`), plus suggested CI workflow.

- Workflow and PRs:
  - Branch `module4` created and merged into `main` with deterministic whitespace and tests.
  - Prepared handover prompts for Module 5 (Automation Plan Emitter) for ChatGPT/Cursor with guardrails and acceptance criteria.
