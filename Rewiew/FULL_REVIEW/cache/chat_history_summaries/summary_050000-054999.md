Highlights

- Module 8 — Accesare (Adăugare) review wrap:
  - Polished validator: added `--fail-empty-buckets` (default on) and US path print; review:init/report flows demonstrated; idempotency verified.
  - Docs updated with cheatsheet; status Approved; minor path typos corrected; toggle semantics clarified (Active↔Șterse).

- Module 9 — Accesare (Vizualizare) review delivery:
  - Added viz scripts (gen/extend/report) and produced `docs/modules/Accesare_Vizualizare.md` (Status: Approved); idempotency checks passed.
  - Narrowed `.gitignore` so module docs are tracked; prepared Accesare index/back‑links patch and PR instructions.

- Handover prompts:
  - Prepared one‑shot prompts to finalize Module 9 docs (index + back‑links) and to batch process all Accesare functionalities.
  - Began planning for Excel‑wide conversion: standardized review schema, MD template, and runbook.

Notes

- PowerShell hygiene reiterated (use `;`, avoid piping to `cat`).
- Traceability emphasized for review flows and docs changes.
