# FULL_REVIEW workspace

Purpose: consolidated analysis artifacts for the end-to-end project overview.

Structure:
- `overview.md` — final comprehensive project overview
- `timeline.md` — chronological milestones and pivots
- `current_state.md` — repo and workspace snapshot (packages, scripts, gates)
- `changes_and_decisions.md` — what changed, why, impacts
- `next_steps.md` — prioritized, actionable next steps
- `sources_index.md` — pointers to inputs used (files and generated indices)
- `cache/` — derived indices, chunked logs, temporary files

Notes:
- Generated on Windows/PowerShell; all paths are relative to repo root.
- Do not commit large cache chunks if unnecessary; keep indices and summaries.
