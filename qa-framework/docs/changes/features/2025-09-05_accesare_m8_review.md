title: "M8 Human-in-the-loop Review — Accesare (Adăugare)"
date: 2025-09-05
category: feature
---

What
- Append M8 review columns to `qa-framework/tmp_exports/Accesare_Automation.csv` (idempotent) and complete review for ≥10 Adăugare rows.
- Generate module summary Markdown at `qa-framework/docs/modules/Accesare_Review_Summary.md`.

Why
- Module 8 requires human review dispositions and feasibility for prioritization and executor readiness.

How
- Used planner CLI `plan:review:init` to ensure 6 review columns exist with UTF-8 BOM + CRLF and RFC4180 quoting.
- Filled review columns for existing Accesare/Adăugare rows and appended additional reviewed rows to reach ≥10.
- Generated summary via `plan:review:summary` with totals by disposition and feasibility.

Impacts
- Affects `tmp_exports/Accesare_Automation.csv` and adds `docs/modules/Accesare_Review_Summary.md`.
- No runtime or build pipeline changes.

Testing
- Re-ran `plan:review:init` to confirm idempotency (file hash unchanged).
- Verified Markdown includes title, timestamp, counts.
