# Logging & Observability

- Use get_logger(__name__) from ADEF and logger.timer("operation") for timings.
- Sanitize sensitive fields; never log secrets.
- Prefer audit logs for config/security events.

Examples:
```python
from src.infrastructure.monitoring.logger import get_logger
logger = get_logger(__name__)
with logger.timer("operation_name"):
    pass
```
